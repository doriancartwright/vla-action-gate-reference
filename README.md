# VLA Action Gate Reference

Reference implementation of a VLA action gate for validating robot action commands before physical execution.

## Overview

VLA Action Gate Reference demonstrates a minimal AI-to-actuator validation boundary for Vision-Language-Action robot systems.

A VLA model may propose an action, but the proposed command is evaluated by a policy gate before the command is forwarded to a downstream robot execution layer.

The reference gate returns one of three decisions:

- `ALLOW`
- `DENY`
- `MODIFY`

## Example Use Cases

The reference gate can deny or modify commands based on:

- Human proximity
- Emergency stop state
- Workspace bounds
- Velocity limits
- Force limits
- Torque limits
- Battery sufficiency
- Role authorization
- Denied action types

## Scope Boundary

This repository is not a production actuator-enforcement system.

It does not include motor-driver enforcement, cryptographic actuator release tokens, ownership or custody gating, infrastructure gating, resource gating, identity or role gating, safety certification, or multi-gate actuation arbitration.

Commercial implementations may require a separate TrustRobotics license.

## Intended Use

This project is intended for research, prototyping, interoperability testing, and developer education.

It is not safety-certified and should not be used as the sole control boundary for any real robot, vehicle, industrial system, medical system, or human-facing autonomous system.

## Quick Start

Run the reference gate demo:

```bash
python examples/demo_gate.py
